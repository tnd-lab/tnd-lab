# TND Lab - Telecom Neural Detection Lab

At TND Lab, we focus on harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to advance telecommunication and radar detection. By exploring the statistical and stochastic characteristics of wireless channels and waveforms, we apply these findings to create more reliable and effective AI/ML-powered solutions tailored for telecom and radar systems.
